# AWS EBS Snapshots
This simple utility allows you to automatically snapshot EBS volumes across your AWS account(s).

The script is designed to be executed directly from the CLI or some automated process that provides the flags. Lambda support has been stripped out for the time being and will be reintroduced at a later date.

## Usage
More documentation coming in time, but for now see `-h` for usage details.
